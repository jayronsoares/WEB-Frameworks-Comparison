What if you could see the same project developed with the most famous WEB frameworks?

The Project
-----------

I will try to develop a [Task List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Task_list) application on few of the most famous WEB framworks of [PHP](http://php.net/), [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).. and this list of languages will grow for sure... Maybe [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)?

Why
----

This idea came after reading the article [PHP: a fractal of bad design](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), not because the "PHP is bad" part, but more because I wanted to learn about how others build the WEB that we know.

I want to study and practice other programming languages​​, that's why I decided to create this project.

I was also inspired by the [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/) way of life.

Who am I
--------

My name is [Thiago Belem](http://thiagobelem.net/), I'm a web developer and I work mainly with [PHP](http://php.net/)... Yeah, I love [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/).

I'm also the creator and teacher of [Assando Sites](http://assando-sites.com.br/), an online  [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) course.

Framework List
==============

I do want to use micro and "bloated" frameworks... and these are the ones that I intend to use:

PHP
---

* CakePHP - <http://cakephp.org/>
* Zend Framework - <http://framework.zend.com/>
* CodeIgniter - <http://codeigniter.com/>
* Symfony - <http://symfony.com/>
* Yii - <http://www.yiiframework.com/>
* Slim ![](http://i.imgur.com/q7QV7.png "Micro Framework") - <http://www.slimframework.com/>
* Twitto ![](http://i.imgur.com/q7QV7.png "Micro Framework") - <http://twitto.org/>

Python
------

* Django - <http://djangoproject.com/>
* Pylons - <http://www.pylonsproject.org/>
* web2py - <http://www.web2py.com/>
* Flask ![](http://i.imgur.com/q7QV7.png "Micro Framework") ![](http://i.imgur.com/sOn8d.png) - <http://flask.pocoo.org/>

Ruby
----

* Ruby on Rails - <http://rubyonrails.org/>
* Sinatra ![](http://i.imgur.com/q7QV7.png "Micro Framework") - <http://www.sinatrarb.com/> 

What else?
==============

HTML & CSS
----------

I will use the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (v.2.0.2) for the project markup, as you can see here:

https://github.com/TiuTalk/WEB-Frameworks-Comparison/tree/master/resources/markup

Database
--------

I will try to use [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/) whenever possible, this way I can push the database (**.db** file) with the project.

If one of these frameworks doesn't support SQLite3 i'll stick with the good ol' [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and include the **.sql** file on the project.


Disclaimer
==========

I've never used most of these frameworks!
-----------------------------------------

I know a lot of PHP, very little of Python, and I've never developed in Ruby (except for a few Dojos).

Probably I am not going to create the best code or the most elegant (and common) solution with each of these frameworks. This project is more like a deliberate practice and learning session than a showoff... So don't judge me by the code.

Feel free to warn me, send a pull-request with an improvement for the project or suggest one framework that should get on the list.
